I’m {{ site.firstName }}, a product designer with 10+ years of experience. I specialize in building efficient, modular, and accessible systems, navigating complex problem spaces through strategic thinking, storytelling, and collaboration. I design scalable, inclusive interfaces and I validate those ideas through prototyping, working closely with cross-functional teams to deliver solutions aligned with user needs and long-term business goals.
