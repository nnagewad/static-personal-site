My name is {{ site.firstName }}. I am a senior interaction designer with over 10 years of experience designing products and services. I am interested in designing efficient, modular systems that are inclusive and accessible to all users.

<p class="list-lead-in">For me to navigate and wrangle through complex and ambiguous problem spaces:</p>

- I apply strategic thinking with a growth and future-thinking mindset while considering the impact it will have on the system itself.
- I utilize storytelling methodology to engage colleagues and senior leaders in the problem space I'm currently exploring.
- I facilitate inclusive design-centric workshops, attended by members within a multi-disciplinary agile team, to unlock their creativity to solve design challenges.
- I design sustainable and scalable components and user interfaces in Figma with inclusivity and accessibility in mind.
- I develop interactive prototypes using HTML, CSS, and Javascript when testing our hypothesis with our end-users.

I strongly believe that iterating as well as collaborating with other designers, researchers, data specialists, developers, and product leaders will lead to a solution that complies with user needs, is scalable and sustainable to implement; and lastly, aligns with the organizationâ€™s current and long-term strategy.
