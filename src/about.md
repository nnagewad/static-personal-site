<p>Hello, I’m Nikin, a senior interaction designer with over 10+ years of experience designing products and services.</p>

<p>In order to navigate and wrangle through complex and ambiguous problem spaces:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
  <li>I apply strategic-thinking with a growth mindset.</li>
  <li>I facilitate inclusive workshops attended by members within a multi-disciplinary agile team.</li>
  <li>I design inclusive and accessible user-interfaces via Figma.</li>
  <li>I develop interactive prototypes using HTML, CSS and Javascript when testing our hypothesis with our end-users.</li>
</ul>

<p>I strongly believe that collaborating with other designers, researchers, developers and product leaders will lead to a solution that complies with user needs, is technically feasible to implement, and that aligns with the organization’s current and long-term strategy.</p>
