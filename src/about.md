<p>Although he graduated with a degree in film studies, Nikin’s interest in technology and design led him to a career in UX design. From Freshbooks to Say Yeah!, Nikin helped craft interfaces and front-end code that balanced business and user objectives.</p>

<p>Having spent all his life in Canada, Nikin moved to London, England in spring 2019 where he’s now focused on supporting the Government Digital Service as an interaction designer.</p>

<p>Aside from his day-to-day work, Nikin is an avid photographer, aiming to capture the everyday as cinematic.</p>
