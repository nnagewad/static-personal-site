<p>Hello, I’m Nikin, a senior interaction designer with over 10+ years of experience designing products and services.</p>

<p>Throughout my career I apply the following skills to help me navigate and wrangle through complex and ambiguous problem spaces:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
  <li>By applying strategic-thinking with a growth mindset.</li>
  <li>Facilitating inclusive workshops attended by members within a multi-disciplinary agile team.</li>
  <li>Designing user-interfaces that are inclusive and accessible to all users using software like Figma.</li>
  <li>Using HTML, CSS and Javascript to develop interactive prototypes to be used during user-testing sessions.</li>
</ul>

<p>I strongly believe that collaborating with other designers, researchers, developers and product leaders will lead to a solution that complies with users and their needs, is technically feasible to implement, and that aligns with the organization’s current and long-term strategy.</p>
