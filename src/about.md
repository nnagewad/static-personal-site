My name is Nikin, I am a senior interaction designer with over 10+ years of experience designing products and services. I am interested in designing efficient and modular systems that are inclusive and accessible to all users.

<p class="list-lead-in">In order for me to navigate and wrangle through complex and ambiguous problem spaces:</p>

- I apply strategic-thinking with a growth mindset, while thinking about the impact it will have to the system itself.
- I facilitate inclusive design workshops attended by members within a multi-disciplinary agile team
- I design inclusive and accessible components and user-interfaces in Figma.
- I develop interactive prototypes using HTML, CSS and Javascript when testing our hypothesis with our end-users.

I strongly believe that collaborating with other designers, researchers, developers and product leaders will lead to a solution that complies with user needs, is technically feasible to implement, and that aligns with the organizationâ€™s current and long-term strategy.
