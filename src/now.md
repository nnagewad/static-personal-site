A handful of photos taken in Paris are now live on [Everyday Lens](https://everydaylens.photos).

Saw [SML](https://www.sml.band/) on Thursday evening at the Church of Sound (wish I brought my camera for that show).

Tonight, I'll be seeing the legendary [Tortoise](https://www.trts.com/) at the Barbican Centre.

Non-music related, work is getting interesting, in a good way. We'll see what comes of it...
