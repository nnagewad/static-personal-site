Saw a early preview of [Sentimental Value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentimental_Value) at the Barbican last night.

Uploaded a few more photos on [Everyday Lens](https://everydaylens.photos)

Been using [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) to help build an iOS app that I've been thinking about for a couple years... So far, really impressive how it works.

Today is my last day at work (for 2025) before I head to Toronto, Canada for the holidays.

Wishing everyone a safe and happy holidays.
